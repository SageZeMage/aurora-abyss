    <description>You conjure a small ball of water and hurl it at a point you can see within range, which can be extended through hydromancy. The ball then expands in an explosive blast of water. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 20 feet away from the center of the sphere. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed half as far.

The spell produces 50 gallons of water, which spreads out across the ground, extinguishing unprotected flames and forming a thin puddle in the area.


At Higher Levels.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and the amount of water produced increases by 10 gallons for each slot level above 3rd.</description>

    <description>You transform a willing creature you touch into a pool of water for the duration. Any objects the target is carrying or wearing meld into its new form and are inaccessible, though it continues to be affected by anything it was wearing, such as armor. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. While in this form, the target is under the following effects:

It gains a swimming speed of 30 feet, and can move over or through other liquids.

It is indistinguishable from a normal pool of water while it remains motionless, and is invisible while underwater.

It has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.

It can't be grappled or knocked prone.

It can enter and occupy the space of another creature, and can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

It extinguishes nonmagical flames in any space it enters.

It can't talk, attack, or cast spells.</description>

  <element name="Brine Sphere" type="Spell" source="ABYSS" id="ID_ABYSS_SPELL_Brine_Sphere">
    <description>Choose a point you can see within range. You cause water within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point to rapidly cool and increase in salinity. The area becomes foggy and lightly obscured for the duration, and a creature moving through the area must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 cold damage and is poisoned until the spell ends. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. If a poisoned creature ends its turn outside of the sphere, it can make another Constitution saving throw, ending the condition on a success. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are holding their breath aren't poisoned by this spell.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the sphere up to 30 feet in any direction, so long as the sphere remains underwater.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.</description>

    <description>You cause a solid surface within range to shift and break apart, creating a chasm. You can make the chasm up to 5 miles long, 500 feet wide, and 100 feet deep. This spell splits earth and stone, but can't manipulate artificial construction. Man-made structures in the area of the chasm shift to accommodate the new terrain, moving harmlessly to whichever side of the chasm it is closer to. When complete, the chasm then fills with your choice of saltwater or freshwater, forming a gulf.</description>

Each creature in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 cold damage and is restrained until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained, but its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.

    <description>You bestow a curse upon a 30-foot cube within range, eating away metal within the area. Each object thinner than 3 inches in any dimension made of metal within the area is destroyed (including nonmagical shields, weapons, and ammunition). Objects that aren't completely destroyed by the spell become coated with a layer of rust. Each nonmagical suit of medium or heavy armor made of metal within the area instead takes a permanent -5 penalty to the AC it offers. If the penalty reduces the armor's AC to 10 or lower, it is destroyed. Otherwise, the armor seizes at the joints, and a creature wearing it becomes restrained. A creature restrained by the armor can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.

Objects made of silver, gold, platinum, mithril, and adamantine are unaffected by this spell.


At Higher Levels.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you target an additional 30-foot cube for each slot level above 4th. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube, and must originate from a point within range.</description>

    <description>You manifest the pressure of the deep sea in a 20-foot-cube within range, which can be extended through hydromancy. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. Each creature within the area when the spell is cast must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become blinded and restrained for the duration. Each creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must also succeed on a Strength saving throw or become blinded and restrained for the duration. A creature has advantage on the saving throw if it has a swimming speed, and automatically succeeds if it is immune to the effects of being underwater at a depth greater than 100 feet.

A creature restrained by the spell that starts its turn within the area takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending the spell on itself on a success.

When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, each creature restrained by the spell takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each round that has passed since you cast the spell from the change in pressure.

    <description>The image of an overflowing chest of treasure appears in a space you can see within range. When a creature comes within 5 feet of the chest for the first time, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is entranced by the chest and is charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the target is no longer charmed. The charm also ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

If a creature uses its action to examine the chest, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature and it becomes immune to the spell's effects.</description>

Roll 12d8; if the target has hit points equal to or fewer than the total, it begins suffocating and becomes unable to breathe or speak for the duration.

    <description>You invoke the spirits of nature to protect an area on  near the sea. The area can be as small as a 30-foot cube or as large as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and other structures are excluded from the affected area. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.

The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

The entire warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. That spell's caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.

 You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating in the air.

 You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog with whirlpools, as if they were affected by a control water spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the water is smooth and the current guides them around any treacherous areas.

 You can animate up to three waves in the area, causing them to move on independently of the current. These wave have the same statistics as a water weird. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the cove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, the cove guardians do nothing. The cove guardians can't leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the waves return to the sea.

 You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:

A constant riptide in four locations of your choice

Plant growth in one location of your choice

A steam vent in one location of your choice

To a creature immune to this effect, the water parts to allow them and any vehicle they are aboard to pass.</description>

The creature is blinded and deafened.

The creature takes 6d6 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns, which it perceives as bludgeoning damage from the pressure around it. Creatures that are immune to the effects of being underwater at a depth greater than 100 feet are immune to this effect.

The creature must hold its breath or begin immediately suffocating. If the creature attempts to breathe, speak, or open its mouth, it begins suffocating. Creatures with the ability to breathe underwater are immune to this effect.

The creature must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves, and has disadvantage on melee weapon attacks it makes with weapons other than daggers, javelins, shortswords, spears, or tridents. Creatures with a swimming speed are immune to this effect.

A creature that uses an action to examine its surroundings can determine that it is experiencing an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature is no longer blinded or deafened, can breathe normally, and no longer takes psychic damage from this spell at the start of its turn.</description>

    <description>You touch a vehicle that fits within a 30-foot cube and infuse it with energy. Until the spell ends, the vehicle gains a +2 bonus to its AC, and its speed increases by 10 feet. If the vehicle is pulled by one or more creatures, each creature's speed increases by 10 feet while it is pulling the vehicle.

Any enclosed spaces within the vehicle double in all dimensions, though this produces no visible change noticeable from outside of the vehicle. A creature that passes into the vehicle experiences the sensation of the space around it rapidly expanding when it enters the vehicle, and conversely experiences the outside world shrinking around it when it exits the vehicle.

If you cast this spell on the same vehicle every day for 30 days, the effect lasts until it is dispelled.

    <description>You imbue a pool of water with holy energy, creating a water weird in an unoccupied space within range. The water weird is bound to the pool of water, and dies if it leaves the water or if that water is destroyed. The water weird reverts back into nonmagical water when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

A creature in the iceberg is restrained and has total cover against attacks and other effects that originate from outside of its own space.

The iceberg is a Gargantuan object with AC 12 and 100 hit points, and it is vulnerable to fire damage.

    <description>You name a destination and conjure a Gargantuan force in the form of a spectral whale, which appears in a body of water within range and lasts until the spell ends. If there isn't enough room for the whale to manifest, the spell fails. When it is conjured, the whale immediately devours you and up to 5 willing creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you, and then begins traveling toward the named destination, which must border a river, ocean, or other body of water, or be underwater. If the destination and your starting body of water are not connected by at least one water route, the spell fails.

The whale has a swimming speed of 300 feet, and can move 30 miles in an hour (240 miles in 8 hours). It travels at a depth of 30 feet in bodies of water that can accommodate it, or otherwise along the surface. Upon reaching your final destination, the whale disgorges you and all other passengers on the shoreline nearest the destination, and the spell ends. If the whale does not reach the destination by the time the spell ends, it discharges all creatures inside it on the nearest piece of solid ground.

The interior of the whale is warm, comfortable, and relatively dry, with enough air to sustain all passengers for the duration of the spell. Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can enter or exit the whale. The whale is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the whale damage anything outside it.

A disintegrate spell targeting the whale destroys it without harming anything inside it.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the whale's speed increases by 50 feet (5 miles per hour) for each slot levels above 5th.</description>

  <element name="Kllimkaklaeia's Coral Corral" type="Spell" source="ABYSS" id="ID_ABYSS_SPELL_Kllimkaklaeia_s_Coral_Corral">
    <description>This spell creates an array of coral chunks, which float on the surface of a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range, which can be extended through hydromancy.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. When an affected creature moves into or out of the sphere for the first time on a turn, bristling coral blooms from the coral chunk nearest to it, and the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 piercing damage and be restrained by the coral until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the coral can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

Additionally, the sphere grants half cover against attacks that pass into or out of it.


At Higher Levels.

When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you create additional spheres of coral centered on the same point: a second 30-foot-radius sphere with a 5th-level slot, a third 45-foot-radius sphere with a 7th-level slot, and a fourth 60-foot-radius sphere with an 9th-level slot.</description>

The ship is a Gargantuan force with an AC of 15 and 500 hit points, can carry up to 150 tons of creature and cargo, has a speed on the water of 50 feet (5 miles an hour), requiring no crew to steer or man it.

    <description>This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.

If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.

If you cast this spell using 1 action and choose a point on the surface of a body of water, you can choose the following effect instead of the spell's normal effect:

 This spell channels vitality into the water within a 100-foot radius circle on the surface of a body of water, causing a sudden bloom of life. The surface of the water in the area becomes opaque, covered by vibrant red algae, and the water in a 100-foot-radius, 100-foot-tall cylinder extending down from the surface in the area becomes unbreathable. Creatures within the cylinder that can breathe water are unable to breathe. Additionally, each creature that starts its turn in the cylinder must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of its next turn.

If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.</description>

When a creature moves through the portal, it appears in the depths: a 20-foot-radius column of water that extends downward indefinitely, with an opening at the top in the shape of the portal. A creature can enter or exit the depths by passing through the portal.

If the portal is on the surface of a body of water, the water within the depths count as part of that body of water.

When a creature starts its turn within the depths, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature take 4d6 cold damage, sinks 50 feet into the water, and becomes stunned until the start of its next turn. Additionally, if a creature starts its turn at a depth of 100 feet or more, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet of depth past 100 feet, to a maximum of 20d6. Creatures that are native to the deep sea automatically succeed on this saving throw and are immune to all damage from this spell.

As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can cause water from the portal to leap out and grab at a creature you can see within 10 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be dragged through the portal, into the depths.

When the spell ends, any creatures and objects within the depths are shunted to the nearest unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the portal.

If any part of the area comes into contact with fire, the entire area erupts into flames and burns away in 1 round, dealing 4d8 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire. The spell ends when the sulfur is burned away.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</description>

    <description>You cause a spout of water to emerge from a 5-foot-square on the ground or on the surface of water that you can see within range, which can be extended through hydromancy. Water emerges to fill a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 5-foot diameter that rises from the chosen square and lasts for the duration.

A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, which it can choose to fail. On a failed save, a creature is pushed to the top of the cylinder. On a successful save, a creature is pushed 5 feet out of the area into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is available, the creature automatically fails the saving throw.

The force of the water is enough to keep creatures aloft, though it is impossible for a creature to stand at the top of the waterspout unless it can normally stand on water. A creature that can't stand on water is prone while it remains at the top of the cylinder.

Water created by this spell vanishes when the spell ends.


At Higher Levels.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the height of the cylinder increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.</description>

The veil is 1 inch thick and transparent, but causes visual distortions of anything observed through it.

When a creature makes an attack, casts a spell, or uses an ability that targets a creature or object on the other side of the veil, roll a d20. On a roll of 10 or lower, the attack, spell, or ability fails or misses.</description>

    <description>You touch a pool of water that is fully contained within a 60-foot radius, blessing and purifying it. For the duration, the pool's contents becomes holy water. When a creature enters the water for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it regains 1 hit point if it is not a fiend or undead. A fiend or undead instead takes 2d6 radiant damage.

Additionally, any creature that spends 1 minute bathing in the water gains one of the following benefits:

One disease or condition afflicting the target is removed.

One curse, including the target's attunement to a cursed magic item, is ended.

Any reduction to one of the target's ability scores or maximum hit points is ended.

The target's lifespan is increased by 1d4 years. A creature can only gain this benefit once in its lifetime.

Any water removed from the blessed pool loses these benefits, though it is clean, safe to drink, and has a pleasant mineral taste.


At Higher Levels.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th-level or higher, the water remains blessed for 1 year. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the water is blessed until the spell is dispelled.</description>
